## **📅 Duration Calculation System**

### **How It Works:**
```
Timeline calculated BACKWARDS from voting start date

Example: Voting starts March 15th
March 1-7:     Election Setup (7 days before voting)
March 8-14:    Voter Registration (7 days before voting)
March 10-12:   Candidate Registration (3 days before voting)
March 13-14:   Campaign Period (2 days before voting)
March 15-17:   Voting Period (3 days)
March 18:      Results Processing (1 day)
March 19:      Results Announcement (immediate)
```

### **Why These Durations:**
- **7 days setup**: Configure election properly, test system
- **7 days registration**: Register all voters, generate codes, deliver codes
- **3 days candidates**: Admin review documents, add candidates, assign positions
- **2 days campaign**: Fair campaign period, material review
- **3 days voting**: All voters can participate, handle volume
- **1 day results**: Verify votes, calculate results, certify
